# Haskell Ninety Nine
A set of tests to allow the quick and easy solving of the haskell ninety nine problems from the Haskell wiki

# Testing your solutions
Simply replace `implementThis` with your implementation for each function in the NinetyNineSolutions.hs file.
To run this file, make sure you have the haskell platform, and simply:
$ make
$ ./ninety-nine-solutions

# Tests
The test structures were copied from the google codelab haskell 101 and 102 courses. I'd recommend watching those videos and going through those practice tasks:
